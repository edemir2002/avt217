	<h1>On & On By Armin Van Buuren </h1>
	<h1>And on and on we'll go</h1>
	<h1>Through the wastelands,through the highways</h1>
	<h1>And on and on we'll go</h1>
	<h1>Oh, on we'll go</h1>
	<h1>Finding life along the way</h1>
	<h1>Melodies we haven't played</h1>
	<h1>No, I don't want no rest</h1>
	<h1>Echoin' around these walls</h1>
	<h1>Fighting to create a song(yeah)</h1>
	<h1>I don't wanna miss a beat</h1>
